# Anomaly-Detection-with-Autoencoder

In an industry, time equals money. Each minute a machine breaks down, it affects the workflow, production stops, revenue dwindles. It is imperative for the company to have a contingency plan such as having a backup machine to prevent the process coming to a standstill or another solution which is even better is to know in advance which machine will breakdown and when so that corrective measures can be applied. In this project I analyzed the vibrational data of AC motors used in the Dyeing Department of a Textile company I was working and devised an anomaly detection algorithm that would help the production engineers to have a proper planning in case of breakdown. With such a system, the aim is to reduce financial loss that incurs due to unanticipated machine breakdown.
